"""
The Fibonacci sequence goes like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number can be found by adding up the two numbers before it, and the first two numbers are always 1.

Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number in the sequence.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 30

Example 1
Input
n = 1
Output
1
Explanation
This is the base case and the first fibonacci number is defined as 1.
