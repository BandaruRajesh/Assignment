"""
You are given an integer list nums containing 0s and 1s. Consider an operation where we pick an index i in nums and flip i as well as all numbers to the right of i. Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums contain all 0s.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 1, 0]
Output
2
Explanation
We can flip at index 0 to get [0, 0, 1] and then flip at index 2 to get [0, 0, 0]
